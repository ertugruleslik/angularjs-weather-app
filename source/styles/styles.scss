/**
 * Third Import Melange Core
 * Melange Core is a super set of normalize library.
 * It has general definitions of certain elements such as labels, form fields, buttons, media object without
 * any predefined templates. Main purpose of the Melange is never overwrite any framework definitions
 * during coding. Every definition, class names can change via settings and merges itself with your GUI.
 * Also, Melange has two sets for width definitions.
 * One is a simple grid system with gutter added between columns as paddings. Using a padding gutter and box-sizing: border-box
 * definition, adds more control over responsive designs. These columns floated by default and support up to 18-column grids.
 * This grid system is a fluid grid. You need to add breakpoint definitions for responsive designs.
 * Other width types are fragmented widths such as .one-half, .two-thirds, .three-quarters etc. These are defined by percentages and
 * missing the 100% fragment except in .one-whole definitions. Simply, there are no .two-halves, .three-thirds, .four-quarters classes
 * which are equal to .one-whole :)
